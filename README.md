# LCD Editor Pro

![Screenshot](Screenshot.png)

**LCD Editor Pro** is an advanced and powerful online tool for creating and editing LCD character designs. Unlike traditional LCD character editors that only support one character at a time, this tool allows you to design multiple characters simultaneously, enabling the creation of complex and realistic LCD layouts. Whether you're working on a small display or a large multi-character LCD, this editor has you covered.

Built with modern web technologies like [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), [Astro](https://astro.build/), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), LCD Editor Pro offers a seamless and intuitive user experience.
